TODO list for auto-correct
==========================

 * save the changes in the prefs dialog as changesets; if we cannot write
   because of a failing lock, we should re-read the file once we can; then we
   apply the changeset (after checking that the change hasn't already
   happened); this way we should be able to keep changes even if two processes
   change the data at the same time

 * support disabling of system-installed defaults

 * support merging multiple sets (system vs. user; generic vs. languages)
